# Signal

This project is a quick exploration of Vue 3 and its capabilities.

## Progress

As of now, the following milestones have been achieved:

1. **Component Markup**: All component markup has been built using Vue 3. This includes the structure of the components and the relationships between them.

2. **Styling**: Advanced styling has been applied to all components using Bulma, a modern CSS framework based on Flexbox. Additional custom styles have been added, including a linear gradient under `h1` headings and conditional styling based on whether a number is positive or negative.

3. **Deployment Pipeline**: A deployment pipeline has been set up to GitHub Pages. This allows for continuous deployment of the application, ensuring that the live version is always up to date with the latest changes.


## Deployment

The application is deployed to GitHub Pages. You can view the live application [here](https://ztfo.github.io/signal/).

## Future Work

The next steps for this project include enhancing the interactivity of the components, refining the styling, and adding more advanced features. The project will continue to evolve as new Vue 3 features and best practices are explored.
