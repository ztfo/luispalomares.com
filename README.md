# Signal

This project is a quick exploration of Vue 3 and the SPC model. It serves as a playground for trying out new CSS tricks and building a robust web application.

## Progress

As of now, the following milestones have been achieved:

1. **Component Markup**: All component markup has been built using Vue 3. This includes the structure of the components and the relationships between them.

2. **Styling**: Basic styling has been applied to all components using Bulma, a modern CSS framework based on Flexbox.

3. **Deployment Pipeline**: A deployment pipeline has been set up to GitHub Pages. This allows for continuous deployment of the application, ensuring that the live version is always up to date with the latest changes.

## Deployment

The application is deployed to GitHub Pages. You can view the live application [here](https://ztfo.github.io/signal/).

## Future Work

The next steps for this project include enhancing the interactivity of the components, refining the styling, and adding more advanced features.
